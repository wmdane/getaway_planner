Project 1 for Coding Bootcamp

When I search for a city, then I am presented with the city name, 10 popular restaurants & 10 local breweries in the city along with their address and a link to their website, as well as the weather of that city for the next 7 days in a easy to read format that loads vertically down the page. When I find a restaurant or brewery that catches my interest, I can save that item to a column on the right side of the page to easily keep track of which entries I want to remember.
